             Last March I found myself traveling down an unfamiliar track when my job at the MTA ended due to Covid.  I asked myself, “What would be a valuable new skill to help my career thrive during and after Covid? And what field would provide the opportunity for ongoing growth?” I decided to learn to coding. After an intro course I was convinced coding was a skill for which I had a propensity. Coding was fun and engaging. I was grateful to be able to return to my childhood home in New Jersey and in September I began the six-month coding bootcamp at Rutgers University.

                Turns out that coding is very much like a hobby I’ve enjoyed for many years, jigsaw puzzling. I always have one going on my coffee table. Coding, like a puzzle, is a series of pieces that need to fit together perfectly. Both can take a long time to complete; both require patience and determination. And both can be done alone or with others. I have found that placing the final piece in a challenging jigsaw puzzle feels a lot like the satisfaction of seeing the code “work.”
